# BBPad - Product Requirements Document

## Product Overview

**Product Name**: BBPad  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Target Audience**: Clojure/Babashka developers and their non-technical collaborators  
**Platform**: Cross-platform desktop application (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Problem Statement

Developers need an easy way to share executable Babashka scripts with non-technical users. Current solutions require technical setup (installing bb, understanding command line, etc.) which creates barriers for script adoption and collaboration.

## Solution

BBPad provides a LINQPad-inspired desktop application that:
- Executes Babashka scripts in a user-friendly GUI
- Allows script sharing via URLs
- Generates parameter input forms automatically
- Displays rich output with syntax highlighting
- Requires zero technical setup for end users

## Core Features

### 1. Script Execution Engine
- **F1.1**: Execute Babashka scripts locally with full bb feature set
- **F1.2**: Support for JDBC database connections (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.)
- **F1.3**: File I/O operations with proper security boundaries
- **F1.4**: HTTP/API calls with authentication support
- **F1.5**: Rich error handling and user-friendly error messages

### 2. User Interface
- **F2.1**: Native desktop application with dedicated window (no browser)
- **F2.2**: Syntax-highlighted script editor with Clojure/Babashka support
- **F2.3**: Auto-generated parameter input forms from script metadata
- **F2.4**: Rich output display supporting text, tables, charts, and images
- **F2.5**: Script library/history management

### 3. Script Sharing
- **F3.1**: Load scripts via URL (GitHub Gists, raw URLs, etc.)
- **F3.2**: URL protocol handler: `bbpad://load?script=<url>`
- **F3.3**: Export scripts as shareable URLs
- **F3.4**: Local script saving and organization
- **F3.5**: Script versioning and change tracking

### 4. Cross-Platform Support
- **F4.1**: Single executable distribution for each platform
- **F4.2**: Native installer/package for each OS
- **F4.3**: Auto-update mechanism
- **F4.4**: Platform-specific UI conventions (menus, shortcuts, etc.)

### 5. Developer Experience
- **F5.1**: Live script execution with immediate feedback
- **F5.2**: Interactive REPL-like experience
- **F5.3**: Script debugging capabilities
- **F5.4**: Performance monitoring and execution time display

## User Stories

### Epic 1: Basic Script Execution
- **US1**: As a developer, I want to write and execute Babashka scripts in a desktop app
- **US2**: As a non-technical user, I want to run shared scripts without installing anything
- **US3**: As a user, I want to see script results in a readable format

### Epic 2: Script Sharing
- **US4**: As a developer, I want to share scripts via URLs that non-technical users can easily use
- **US5**: As a non-technical user, I want to click a link and immediately run a script with parameters
- **US6**: As a user, I want to save frequently used scripts locally

### Epic 3: Data Operations
- **US7**: As a user, I want to connect to databases and run queries
- **US8**: As a user, I want to process Excel files and convert them to other formats
- **US9**: As a user, I want to make API calls and save results to files

### Epic 4: User Experience
- **US10**: As a user, I want syntax highlighting for better code readability
- **US11**: As a user, I want auto-generated forms for script parameters
- **US12**: As a user, I want rich output display including charts and tables

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture
- **Single Babashka executable** with embedded web server
- **Native WebView** for UI rendering (no external browser dependency)
- **ClojureScript frontend** with UIx/Helix for reactive UI
- **Ring + Jetty** for HTTP server
- **Local file system** for script storage (no database required)

### Performance
- **Startup time**: < 3 seconds on modern hardware
- **Script execution**: Real-time feedback, < 1 second for simple scripts
- **Memory usage**: < 100MB baseline, efficient script execution
- **File size**: < 50MB total application size

### Security
- **Sandboxed execution**: Scripts run with limited file system access
- **Safe defaults**: No network access unless explicitly enabled
- **Input validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **Script verification**: Optional signature verification for shared scripts

## Success Metrics

### User Adoption
- **Primary**: Number of script executions per week
- **Secondary**: Number of shared scripts created
- **Tertiary**: User retention rate (30-day)

### Technical Performance
- **Script execution success rate**: > 95%
- **Application crash rate**: < 1%
- **Average startup time**: < 3 seconds

### User Experience
- **Time to first successful script execution**: < 2 minutes for new users
- **Script sharing success rate**: > 90% of shared URLs work correctly
- **User satisfaction**: > 4.0/5.0 in user surveys

## Out of Scope (v1.0)

- **Collaborative editing**: Real-time script collaboration
- **Cloud storage**: Remote script storage and synchronization
- **Plugin system**: Third-party extensions and plugins
- **Advanced debugging**: Breakpoints, step-through debugging
- **Package management**: Built-in library/dependency management
- **Multi-language support**: Languages other than Babashka/Clojure

## Timeline

### Phase 1: MVP (4-6 weeks)
- Basic script execution engine
- Simple editor with syntax highlighting
- Local script saving
- Cross-platform WebView integration

### Phase 2: Sharing (2-3 weeks)
- URL-based script loading
- Parameter form generation
- Rich output display

### Phase 3: Polish (2-3 weeks)
- Database connectivity
- Packaging and distribution
- Auto-update mechanism
- User experience refinements

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **WebView compatibility**: Cross-platform WebView differences
- **Babashka limitations**: Features not available in bb vs full Clojure

### Medium Risk
- **Script security**: Ensuring safe execution of untrusted scripts
- **Performance**: Large script execution in embedded environment

### Low Risk
- **UI framework**: ClojureScript ecosystem maturity
- **Distribution**: Existing bb packaging solutions
